# [B. Solid Programmer](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429548/problem/B)
> *This problem prompts you to print the sentence **"I'll Be a Solid Programmer"*** to prove it

Just like the previous problem:
 + Use the ```cout``` command.
 + Use the same exact capitalization and spacing as mentioned in the statement.
I hope you will be a solid programmer in the near future :)
