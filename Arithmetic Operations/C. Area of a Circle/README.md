# [C. Area of a Circle](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429626/problem/C)
> *This problem prompts you to print the area of a circle, given it's radius and the value of π.*

+ Use the formula: **Area = π ⋅ r<sup>2</sup>** to find the area.
+ Use variables of type ```double``` to store the value of the given radius.
+ Utilize the given code template to make sure the code prints exactly 9 digits after the decimal point.
> + You can use the function ```pow()``` in the header ```cmath``` to evaluate r<sup>2</sup>, but it's prefered to evaluate it as ```r ⋅ r``` for the purpose of easing the implementation and avoiding the precision errors that occur sometimes when you use this function.
