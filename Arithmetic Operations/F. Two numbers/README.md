# [F. Two numbers](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429626/problem/F)
> *This problem prompts you to print the value of the floor division, the round division, and the ceil division operations on the two given numbers A and B.*

+ Use the builtin ```floor()```, ```round()```, and ```ceil()``` functions in the header ```cmath```.
+ Store the values A and B in varibles of type ```double``` to maintain the decimal value in the division result before passing it to the function.
+ Make sure to print each results in the correct capitalization and spacing the problem requires and on a new line each.
