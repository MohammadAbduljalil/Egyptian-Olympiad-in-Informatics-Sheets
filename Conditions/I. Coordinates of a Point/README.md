# [I. Coordinates of a Point](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429334/problem/I)
> *This problem prompts you to check the position of a point on a cartesian plane regarding the four quadrants, the 2 axes, and the origin point.*

+ Determine the conditions that apply on each section of the plane as follows:
  - ```Q1```: X and Y coordinates are both positive
  - ```Q2```: X is negative and Y is positive
  - ```Q3```: X and Y are both negative
  - ```Q4```: X is positive and Y is negative
  - ```X-axis```: Y is equal to zero
  - ```Y-axis```: X is equal to zero
  - ```Origin point```: X and Y are both equal to zero
+ Use ```if``` conditions to check which of these apply
+ Use the datatype ```double``` as the coordinates can be decimal values (as shown in the sample test case)
