# [C. Max and Min](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429334/problem/C)
> *This problem prompts you to print the minimum then the maximum numbers of three given numbers a, b, and c, seperated by a space.*
+ Use an ```if``` condition.
+ Use the operator ```&&``` to combine two conditions if verifying all of them is needed.
+ If a is smaller than or equal to b and smaller than or equal to c, then a is the minimum of the three numbers.
+ If a is greater than or equal to b and greater than or equal to c, then a is the maximum of the three numbers.
+ Don't forget to print a space between the minimum and the maximum.
