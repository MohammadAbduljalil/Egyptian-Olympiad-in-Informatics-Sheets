# [C. Max and Min](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429334/problem/C)
> *This problem prompts you to print the minimum then the maximum numbers of three given numbers a, b, and c, seperated by a space.*

After implementing the intended conditions solution, I want to introduce you to two very important builtin functions in C++
+ Include the header ```<algorithm>``` that contains the two function ```min()``` and ```max()```
+ Call the function ```min()``` with the three numbers a, b, and c as parameter (contained by curly braces as shown below) and it will return the minimum od them.
+ Use the function ```max()``` similarly.

--> ```min({a, b, c})```

--> ```max({a, b, c})```
