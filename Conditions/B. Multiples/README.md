> *This problem prompts you to check if one of the two given numbers A and B is a multiple of the other or not.*
+ Use an ```if``` condition.
+ Use the operator ```||``` to combine two conditions if verifying one of them is enough
> Remember that the remainder of dividing a multiple n by n is equal to zero, so you you can check if A is a multiple of B by checking if the result of the operation ```A % B``` is equal to zero.
