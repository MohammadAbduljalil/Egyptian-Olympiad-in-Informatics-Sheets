# [H. First digit !](https://codeforces.com/group/6uhngucRCe/contest/429334/problem/H)
> *This problem prompts you to check whether the first digit of a given number X is even or odd.*

+ Given the constraints (999 < x <= 9999), x must always be a 4-digit number
+ The result of the integer division (x / 1000) will always
return the value of the first digit in x
+ You can check whether a number is even by checking whether it's divisible by 2, ie has no remainder when divided by 2
+ You can check the remainder of dividing by 2 by using the modulo operator ```%```
